FOSSEE project internship coding assessment

###Instructions:

###Part A:

####Changing Properties
Option2,Option3 has no functionality. It was just asked to have 3 options<br /><br />

In cmd,<br />
cd PartA/Changing\ Properties/out/Production/Changing\ Properties<br /> 
java com.nimishs.Main<br /> 
<br /><br />OR<br /><br />
Double Click on the packEx.jar located in Production folder to run app<br />


####Student Ranking System

NOTE: I have assummed we have to make a command line application for this problem where user will enter the details.<br /><br />
In cmd,<br />
cd PartA/Student\ Ranking\ System/out/Production/Student\ Ranking\ System<br />
java com.nimishs.Main</br>

######NOTE:
I have followed standard approach putting class files in out dir and src files in src dir. I have used StackOverflow, Oracle docs as my reference.

###Part B:


NOTE: I have assummed we have to make a HTML page using mxGraph JS Tool for this problem.<br /><br />
Switch to the following directory:<br />
PartB\mxGraph\javascript\example<br />
Click on partB.html</br>

######NOTE:
I have been able to make diagram with proper connections. But due to time constraints, I wasn't able to finish the double clicking on animated viewer part. I have used the documentation given in the evaluation license.
