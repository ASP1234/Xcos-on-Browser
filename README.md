FOSSEE project internship coding assessment

###Instructions:

Part A:

####Changing Properties
Option2,Option3 has no functionality. It was just asked to have 3 options<br /><br />

In cmd,<br />
cd PartA/Changing\ Properties/out/Production/Changing\ Properties<br /> 
java com.nimishs.Main<br /> 

####Student Ranking System

NOTE: I have assummed we have to make a command line application for this problem where user will enter the details.<br /><br />
In cmd,<br />
cd PartA/Student\ Ranking\ System/out/Production/Student\ Ranking\ System<br />
java com.nimishs.Main</br>

######NOTE:
I have followed standard approach putting class files in out dir and src files in src dir. I have used StackOverflow, Oracle docs as my reference.
